**30-34% annual SDR turnover.** $97,690 average replacement cost. 250 interviews to hire 10 reps. Only 48% hitting quota.

You've tried the solutions everyone recommends:
- **AI SDR tools** → Generated activity but zero qualified meetings
- **Outsourced teams** → Only 7% of companies make it work long-term
- **More tech stack** → Added complexity without solving the core capacity problem

One SDR costs $60-80K annually to generate $750K in pipeline. That math works—until you calculate how many SDRs you'd need to hit your growth targets. The capacity constraint creates an impossible choice between scaling costs or accepting stagnant pipeline.
