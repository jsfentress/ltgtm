### "We tried outsourced SDRs before. Only 7% of companies make it work."

We're not outsourced SDRs. We're managed AI services with human oversight. You keep control of your brand and messaging—we handle the execution infrastructure. Think of it as your pipeline operations team, not a replacement sales org.

### "AI SDRs just blast generic spam. We've seen the results."

Agreed—that's why we combine AI scale with human judgment. AI handles the volume (signal detection, enrichment, timing), but humans control the strategy (targeting decisions, message approval, quality gates). Every touch is contextual, timely, and relevant to the specific signal that triggered it.

### "This sounds too efficient to be true."

It's not magic. It's math. AI can monitor thousands of signals simultaneously and draft personalized messages at scale—things humans can't do. Humans make strategic decisions and quality judgments—things AI can't do. We combine them instead of choosing one or the other.

### "What if we want to scale down or pause?"

Month-to-month commitment. Cancel anytime. No contracts, no severance, no recruiting delays. Scale up when you need capacity, scale down when you don't. That's the advantage of managed services over full-time headcount.
