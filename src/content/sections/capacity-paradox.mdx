Here's the constraint your board doesn't see:

**Quality outreach requires 15-20 touches per prospect.**
Human SDRs can make 50-80 quality touches daily.
That's **3-4 prospects properly worked per day.**

But you need **50+ prospects worked daily** to hit pipeline targets.

This isn't a performance problem. It's a physics problem. No amount of coaching, tools, or motivation changes the fundamental math: there aren't enough hours in the day for one person to properly engage 50 prospects with 15-20 personalized touches each.

The traditional answer is "hire more SDRs"—which means more recruitment, more training, more turnover, and fixed costs that scale linearly with output.
