You're facing a capacity constraint that traditional approaches can't solve. You have three paths forward:

**1. Continue optimizing your current model.** Hire more SDRs, add more tools, hope the math eventually works. Traditional approaches face traditional scaling limits.

**2. Test managed AI outbound for 30 days.** Risk $3-5K monthly. Get your first qualified meetings within 48 hours. Month-to-month commitment—cancel anytime if it's not working.

**3. Build your own AI infrastructure.** Hire data engineers, ML specialists, and SDR managers. 6-12 month build timeline. Significant CapEx investment.

We only win if you get qualified meetings. You only pay if we deliver value.
