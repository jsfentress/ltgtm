No 3-month ramp. No training programs. No hiring drama.

### Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
We analyze your ICP, competitive positioning, and value proposition. Build your targeting engine with the signals that matter for your specific market. You review and approve the strategy before anything launches.

### Week 1: Launch (Days 4-5)
First campaigns go live with your explicit approval. AI begins monitoring for signals, enriching accounts, and drafting contextual outreach. You see every message before it's sent.

### Week 1+: Results (Day 6 Onward)
Qualified meetings begin flowing. Real-time dashboard shows you what's working—which signals convert, which messages resonate, which prospects engage. You make strategic decisions, we handle execution.

**Timeline comparison:**
- Traditional SDR hiring: 3-6 months to productivity
- Managed AI outbound: First qualified meeting within 48 hours of launch
